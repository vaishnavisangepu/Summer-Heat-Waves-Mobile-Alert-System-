A Summer Heat Waves Mobile Alert System is designed to provide timely warnings and important information about impending heat waves to users via their mobile devices. This system leverages weather data and forecasts from meteorological services to detect when heat waves are likely to occur. Once a heat wave is predicted, the system sends alerts to registered users, offering information on the expected duration and intensity of the heat wave, along with safety tips to manage extreme heat conditions. By delivering real-time notifications, the system helps individuals take necessary precautions, reducing health risks and improving overall safety during periods of extreme heat.
